## Weekly Product Meeting

Every Saturday at 9pm ET (6pm PT | 7pm MT | 8pm CT) we will be hosting a meeting to discuss the HelloVoter mobile app and its accompanying web-app(s). We do this meeting via [Zoom](https://zoom.us/j/540037352) video chat; https://zoom.us/j/540037352

The topic is generally whatever people ask questions about. If nobody attends, I just use the time to code, refine the backlog, or some other related task.

We can demo existing or soon-to-be-released functionality, talk strategy, or answer questions!

**NOTE:** As Our Voice USA is a 501(c)(3) non-profit charity, we will not be engaging in any kind of political discourse. Our mission is to enable anyone to canvas for any cause, at zero cost.

Hope to see you there!
