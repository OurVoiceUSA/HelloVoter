# CANVASSING APP CANVASSING TOOL GUIDELINES

## Your 1st Amendment Rights to Canvass

Your right to free speech is protected under the United States Constitution. An example of this protection can be seen in [Watchtower Society v. Village of Stratton — 536 U.S. 150 (2002)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchtower_Bible_%26_Tract_Society_of_New_York,_Inc._v._Village_of_Stratton) by which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled
that any government body requiring a permit for canvassing for religious or political purposes is unconstitutional. Know your civil rights.

## Abide by the Law

While your right to canvass is a protected right, be mindful of state and municipal rules regarding specific actions you take while canvassing. We provide these guidelines as a general checklist to assist you with canvassing. It is ultimately your responsibility to be aware of and abide by the laws of the community in which you will be using this tool.

### No Soliciting

The HelloVoter mobile app is designed to gather information about people's positions on specific policy issues. We expressly prohibit activities related to the solicitation of products, or for donations, or
other collection of money, while canvassing with the HelloVoter app. Many municipalities also have specific laws regarding solicitation. Basically, the moment you ask for money, you’re a peddler and not a canvasser.

### No Trespassing

If you encounter a residence with a “No Trespassing” sign or similar privacy request, please respect their wishes and move on to the next address. It is highly likely your persistent presence at their doorstep will be met with hostility. Marking addresses like these with the “not interested” pin will help keep other canvassers from trespassing as well.

### No Leaving Materials

Feel free to hand out any materials you may have created for your own canvassing purposes. However, Our Voice USA does not recommend leaving them unattended. Leaving anything on their door or doorstep may be considered littering. Also, adding things in or on mailboxes are off limits. It isn't just nosey, it's a federal offense!

### If you receive compensation

In many areas, there are laws specific to who receive monetary or other compensation for their canvassing activities. If you are being paid to canvass, follow all applicable local laws pertaining to that.

### Data gathering laws

By using the canvassing tool, you are collecting data about the people who live in the area. That data is uploaded to the server you are connected to. From there, it is accessible to other users of the app which you’ve chosen to share it with. Laws in the area may prohibit sharing of data collected in this way. As such, don’t use the canvassing tool where this is prohibited.  

### Data import and sharing

By importing data into the canvassing tool, and sharing a form with others, users are expected to acknowledge and adhere to any and all applicable local, state, and federal laws and statutes regarding voter data and the sharing of that data. Our Voice USA encourages everyone to remain lawful in their activities while using these resources and tools.

### You represent yourself

Our Voice USA provides this canvassing tool for free for you to use for your own purposes. You will be talking to real people and asking real questions about policy positions that matter, and hopefully also collaborating with other canvassers.

By using this tool you acknowledge that you are acting on your own behalf, do not represent Our Voice USA or our affiliates, and have read our canvassing guidelines.

## Be Courteous

### Hours of Operation

Don’t canvass before 10 am or after 8 pm. It is generally safer during daylight hours for both you and the people who will be giving you information.

### Your Voice

You don't need to limit your interaction to the form in the app. Feel free to engage them in conversation. Talk up candidates you support. Wear Identification.

## Canvassing Tips

### Be prepared

Some suggested essentials for a day out canvassing are water, sunscreen, trail mix, and of course, your phone! Dress appropriately for the weather of the day, and check the forecast before heading out!

### Stay safe

If an area looks sketchy, don't go there! Don't feel like you must knock on every single door. If you don't feel right in an area, move on to one in which you feel more comfortable. Your safety and the safety of those with whom you interact are of the highest priority!

### Canvass in groups

No better way to stay safe and have fun than to group up and walk together. The buddy system is the best system! Alternate houses, or do opposite sides of the street, but always be able to see your buddy(s). Before you go out to canvass, consider exchanging cell phone numbers with your teammates for added safety!

### What to say when you knock on a door

Never extend your hand to shake a person’s hand at the door unless they extend theirs first as it can be off-putting to some folks. No matter what the outcome of the encounter, always thank them for their time and remind them to be sure to register and vote!

Our Voice USA will never presume to put words into your mouth, but we can recommend some simple ice-breaker opening lines for those new to chatting up strangers!  The following are merely examples and are in no way required statements for canvassing. Be creative and turn them into your own unique lines!

“Hello [sir] [ma’am], how are you this [morning] [afternoon]? “ <Allow them to answer>
“My name is [your name] and I am gathering some information for [your group’s name] in order to better understand how real people like you and I think and feel about the big issues we all face as a nation. I am using this canvassing tool on my phone from HelloVoter in order to keep an accurate track of the information people provide. I have just a few important questions to ask you. Do you mind participating for a few minutes?”
“Hey there! My fellow canvassers and I are checking in with everyone we can in [your city/town] so we can get a better understanding of what folks around here think of major issues we all have to deal with these days. My name is [your name] and I am with [your group] and I’d like to spend just a few minutes asking you some simple, yet super important questions while I mark your answers with this HelloVoter canvassing tool. May I ask your name, [ma’am] [sir]?”

### The Importance Of Data

Be as accurate as possible with the information you collect on the resident! Make sure the names and addresses are spelled correctly.

TIP: Read back anything to the resident that you are unsure of to ensure proper data collection. They won’t mind because nobody wants their name spelled wrong!
